## 7. Rules for decision-making during meetings

Meetings can go ahead where the quorum is not met, but no decisions can be made if the meeting is not quorate
All items requiring a decision will need to be on the agenda circulated in advance.
All questions that arise at any meeting will be discussed openly and the meeting will seek to find consent from everyone present.
To pursue this, decision-making will be based on the Sociocracy model. This means that decisions are made when there are no ‘critical concerns’, that is, when there is informed consent from all participants at a meeting. When a proposal or question is raised, the meeting’s chair/facilitator will be responsible for running clarifying questions and critical concerns rounds, where present participants with any critical concerns are invited to come forward and share their questions and points. If the participant raises a critical concern, they are encouraged to suggest a way to address their concern.
If a proposal has failed to reach a consent after being discussed for two consecutive meetings, the group will take a vote and decide based on a simple majority of members present at that second meeting.

## 8. Finances

Any money acquired by Moon Co-op including donations, contributions and bequests, shall be paid into an account operated by the Treasurer in the name of Moon Co-op.
All funds must be used to further the purposes and objectives as specified in item 2 of this constitution and for no other purpose.
Any cheques and payments being made from Moon Co-op’s finance accounts must be signed by at least 2 (two) signatories, 1 (one) of whom must be the Treasurer.
Any income/expenditure shall be the responsibility of the membership and the Treasurer will be accountable to ensure funds are utilised effectively and that  Moon Co-op stays within its budget.
Official accounts shall be maintained, and the annual financial report shall be presented by the Treasurer at the Moon Co-op Annual General Meeting.

## 9. Amendments to the Constitution

Amendments to the constitution may only be made at the Annual General Meeting or a Special General Meeting.
Any proposal to amend the constitution must be given to the Secretary in writing.  The proposal must then be circulated with the notice of meeting.
Any proposal to amend the constitution will require consent of the participants present, failing that a two thirds majority vote of those present.

## 10. Dissolution

If at any meeting those present consent that it is necessary to close down Moon Co-op, the group may call a Special General Meeting to do so. The sole business of this meeting will be to dissolve the group.
If it is agreed to dissolve the group, all remaining money and other assets, once outstanding debts have been paid, will be donated to an organisation reflecting purposes and objectives stated in item 2. The organisation will be agreed at the meeting which agrees the dissolution.

This constitution was agreed at the Inaugural General Meeting of Moon Co-op by all members present:
