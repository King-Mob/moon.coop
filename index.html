        Moon co-op will provide a genuinely affordable and community minded way
        of living for all people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our co-op will be a mix of shared housing and private flats for a
        variety of ways of living.
      </p>
      <p>We could also have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>wildlife garden</li>
        <li>meeting space</li>
        <li>communal kitchen</li>
        <li>workshop</li>
        <li>co-working space</li>
        <li>pub</li>
        <li>shop</li>
        <li>GP</li>
        <li>library</li>
        <li>community cinema</li>
        <li>and more!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We are adaptable: we can build on a brown field site, refurbish
        buildings or manage housing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our co-op is founded on a spirit of joyful participation and channels
        the needs and desires of our members who come from a wide range of life
        circumstances.
