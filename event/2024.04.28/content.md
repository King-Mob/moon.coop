## Who We Are

We are Moon Co-op, a group of South-East Londoners and friends setting up a new housing co-op in the area.

## What is a Housing Co-op?

Housing co-ops are a non-profit model of housing and an alternative to renting from a private landlord or the Council. A housing co-op is an organisation that owns and manages a group of homes - and the co-op is made up of all those people that live in those homes. That means that we essentially act as our own landlord, collectively managing our homes directly as residents, cutting out the middle-man. We pay rent to the co-op, which goes towards e.g. upkeep or paying off the co-op’s mortgage, and we set the level of rent ourselves based on the co-op’s needs.

To set up a co-op we will need to raise money, purchase/lease a group of homes as an organisation, and refurbish them to suit our needs. There is also the option of obtaining unused land, e.g. from the Council, and building something new.

Advantages of Co-op Living:

- Rent can be much cheaper as no one is taking a profit from your housing
- Agency over your own home: residents collectively make decisions about how to manage the properties
- Security: as you are, collectively, your own landlord, you can provide yourself with housing security without the worry that a landlord will kick you out of the property at any time
- Community: as you are managing your home together, living in a co-op provides a sense of community and a combats isolation

Disadvantages?

- You might need to put time and effort into managing your housing collectively with other residents, which may not be for everyone
- Setting up a new co-op is not easy, and will take time and work. But we think it will be worth it.

## Why a New Housing Co-op?

There are hundreds of co-ops in London. In South-East London these include Sanford Street Housing Co-op, Nettleton Road Housing Co-op and Deptford Housing Co-op.

These are great, but unfortunately they often have very long waiting lists to join. There is not enough co-operative housing available, and we want to provide more. We also want to create something that suits our own housing needs and is open to a broad group of people, e.g. is open to families and pets and suitable for us for the long-term.

There are currently around 15 of us regularly involved in organising work. We have formed a group with a constitution, set up a fiscal host (a way of receiving and managing money as a group), and begun planning what we want from our housing and what financial and legal model will suit us, and we have been looking around for a suitable site to refurbish or potentially build on. We are looking to expand the group as we start finalising our plans and aims and continue searching for a suitable place. We are also open to those who do not have time to organise at the moment but would like to stay updated to join in later on. Everything is flexible and at an early stage, so you will be free to contribute to planning what we want from this housing!

Come along on the 28th to find out more and get involved.
